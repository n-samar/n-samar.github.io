      I am a UCLA Computer Science 4th year undergraduate working with
      [Prof. Jason Cong](http://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong). My
      research is currently focused on sorting on FPGAs. Here are links to my
      [CV](https://n-samar.github.io/CV.pdf) and
      [Github profile](https://github.com/n-samar).
