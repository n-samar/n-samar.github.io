      I am a Ph.D. student at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial
      Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) co-advised by Prof. Daniel Sanchez and Arvind.
      I worked with
      [Prof. Jason Cong](http://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong)
      while I was an undergrad at UCLA. My
      research is in computer architecture and systems. <br/><br/> Here are links to my
      [CV](https://n-samar.github.io/CV.pdf) and
      [Github profile](https://github.com/n-samar).
